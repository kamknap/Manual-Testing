# Manual Testing Project

This repository contains various materials related to my manual software testing practice. It includes test cases, bug reports, and other relevant documentation related to manual testing activities. The content is organized into different folders for better structure and easy access.

## Contents:

1. **[Test Cases]([Test-Cases](https://github.com/kamknap/Manual-Testing/tree/main/Test-Cases))**
   - This folder contains test cases I have created and worked on, including detailed steps, data inputs, and expected results for each case.
   - The test cases are organized into different categories such as "Search Bar" and "Cart."

2. **[Bug Reports]([Bug-Reports](https://github.com/kamknap/Manual-Testing/tree/main/Bug-Reports))**
   - This folder contains reports on bugs identified during manual testing. It includes detailed descriptions of issues, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity levels.

## Purpose:
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to create detailed manual test cases, document and report bugs, and organize testing activities effectively. It showcases my skills in manual testing and how I manage the process of verifying software functionality.

Feel free to explore the contents of each folder for more details.
